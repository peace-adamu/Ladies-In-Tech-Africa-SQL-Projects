## Project Review
This repository contains SQL projects completed during the Ladies in Tech Africa SQL class. The projects demonstrate various SQL concepts, including SELECT statements, JOINs, UNIONs, views, and CASE statements.
#### Project Overview
- The repository includes:
- SQL queries for employee and salary databases
- Database design and entity-relationship diagrams
- International Breweries project with profit analysis

## Tools Used
- Database Management System (DBMS): Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Editor: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
  
## SQL Queries
- SELECT statements
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- UNION and UNION ALL
- Views
- CASE statements
- Database Design
- Employee database schema
- Entity-relationship diagram

  ## Example SQL file (queries.sql)
  ```
  -- SELECT statements
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;
SELECT * FROM SALARY;

-- JOINs
SELECT employee.staffid, employee.firstname, employee.gender,
       Salary.department, Salary.salary
FROM employee
JOIN Salary
ON salary.Staffid = employee.staffid;

-- CASE statements
SELECT Staffid, firstname, Gender, state_of_origin, Age,
       CASE
           WHEN Age >= 60 THEN 'Senior Executive'
           WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 59 THEN 'Senior Manager'
           WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN 'Manager'
           WHEN Age <= 29 THEN 'Assistant Manager'
           ELSE 'Unknown'
       END AS AgeGroup
FROM [dbo].[Employee];
```
